== Description ==

Retargeting and Marketing Automation

Personalized email content + Personalized live messages + SMS triggers to deliver to your customers the products they want to buy.

Features

Live Triggers

When you have people in your online shop, if you see that someone's showing a lot of interest in one product, wouldn't you offer them a small discount to make sure they buy it? That's what we thought! 

With our personalized live triggers that's exactly what you'll do, just that you won't have to lift a finger.

E-mail Triggers & Reminders

We all want to market someone when they're in a buying mood, but it's hard to get the right timing. We found a secret formula and you'll have access to it through our e-mail marketing software. Someone leaves the site without finishing the order? We got your back!

Someone browsed the site, found interesting products but didn't press the buy button? We'll remind him about those cool products through a triggered email. And that's not all, we can do so much more with our personalized emails!

SMS Triggers

Nowadays, with everyone checking their phones every 5 minutes, you can't go wrong with this, you're 100% sure that they will see your message. What better way to remind someone that they forgot to finish order a couple of hours ago?

Analytics and Multitesting

We love A/B testing so much that we created Multitesting, an improved and limitless version compared to other email marketing software providers.

You can test as many different versions as you want and you only need one click to add a new one. Did we tell you that you can do this for any e-mail trigger? The perfect marketing automation tool for your online shop!
